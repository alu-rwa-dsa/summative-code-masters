<blockquote> <h2> PROJECT DESCRIPTION: </h2>


Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle

The objective is to fill an n x n grid with digits, e.g., 3*3

Every segment of the row, column, and 2 range contains all the numbers in the range

The n x n grid will have some of the squares filled in at the beginning of the game

The player’s work is to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid using logic.

The aim of the puzzle is to fill in the remaining squares by using all of the numbers 1–9 exactly once in each row, column, and nine 3*3 subgrids. Sudoku is purely dependent on logic, with no algebra involved, and the degree of complexity is determined by the number and locations of the initial numbers.


This assignment has class testing codes for our project game (SUDOKU). Each class has at least 5 test cases. Other classes have 6 test cases. All the tests should run successfully while the following modules and packages are imported/installed

* import numPy
* import Pygame 
* import PyPDF2 
* import random 
* import unittest

 The moves will be incorrect if:
 Any row contains more than one of the same number in the range
 Whichever column contains more than one of the same number in the range
 Any 2×2 grid contains more than one of the same number from the same range

<blockquote> <h2> MOTIVATION: </h2> <br>

Sudoku is a fundamentally boring process that can be done using a computer program using basic rules. The fact that Sudoku is still one of the most successful puzzle games in the world, and that most people who play it don't realize it's a challenge that can be represented with an algorithm, demonstrates how simple it is to confuse action with productivity, and should serve as a wake-up call to all of us to consider what facets of our job actually entail conditioning ourselves to obey a series of well-defined rules with increasing performance. 
The world is changing and we want to prove that with technology we can solve logic-based games just by using lines of code in python. This would therefore save time and find more suitable solutions using python.
Sudoku can be very complicated, particularly if the puzzle has to be generated based on the complexity, which will necessitate the use of Las Vegas as well as a high degree of genericization! The AI component is easy, but depending on your implementation and data structure, it can be complicated.  This is why here we’ve decided to use Arrays to solve our sudoku game instead of matrix which would be more difficult to use when it comes to define the grids.
